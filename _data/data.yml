      while managing a team of 15 highly skilled engineers.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      He worked as a freelance Internet consultant and contractor prior to joining bidorbuy and provided IT consulting and 
      architecture-guidance for companies such as Vodacom South Africa, First National Bank, BG Phoenics GmbH, CEDA Botswana, VHV Hannover, DBV Winterthur, 
      Daimlyer-Chrysler/Smart and Standard Bank of South Africa.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      Gerd is a proactive, experienced senior software architect and developer with a track record of delivering quality solutions quickly 
      in the IT-, financial-, telco-, e-commerce- and government-sectors. During his 26 years in the IT industry he has had roles in executive management, 
      development, systems analysis and project management using technologies like Apache Solr, ElasticSearch, Messaging Platforms (MQ Series, SonicMQ), 
      Application Servers (Tomcat, IBM WebSphere, Jetty) and developed in C, Java / J2EE (JSP, Servlets, EJBs), NodeJS, PHP and Perl on a number of large 
      and complex projects.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      Gerd holds diplomas in Business Management and Marketing Management from the <a title="Damelin Management School - South Africa" href="https://www.damelin.co.za/" target="_blank">Damelin Management School</a> (Rosebank, South Africa) 
      as well as in Business Enterprise Studies and Marketing Management from the <a title="Institute for Commercial Management - United Kingdom" href="http://icm.education/" target="_blank">Institute of Commercial Management</a> (Bournemouth, UK).
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      He has extensive experience in J2EE technologies ranging from the design and development of complex model-view-controller architectures to the integration of legacy mainframe architectures. He has worked with the latest development 
      tools such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse / MyEclipseIDE, IBM Websphere Application Developer, Rational Application Developer, Rational Software Architect and has performed deployments and load-balancing exercises on IBM Websphere Application Server, 
      Tomcat and IBM-/Apache-HTTP Server using various performance monitoring tools.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      <h5 class="container-block-title">Developing &amp; designing branch-banking solutions</h5>
      Gerd began his career in 1992 in Krumpendorf, Austria at <a href="http://www.uniquare.com/en/" target="_blank">Uniquare</a> 
      (formerly known as Genesis Software Consulting) where he worked as a C/C++ Lead Programmer on the development of financial branch-banking solutions and 
      successfully implemented the then largest IBM OS/2 branch-banking solution for Standard Bank of South Africa.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      Between December 2000 and May 2003, he worked as a consultant for the German company <a title="Maas High Tech Software - Germany" href="http://www.maas.de" target="_blank">Maas High Tech Software</a> 
      based in Stuttgart to implement large-scale web-applications in the financial industry. Thereafter Gerd was involved in various projects (SAP portals in Botswana, government projects in Germany, retail banking- and 
      telecommunication-solutions in South Africa).
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      Upon his return to South Africa in June 2004, he joined First National Bank's branch-banking division as Chief Architect in the 
      FNB BBT Risk &amp; Governance division and headed up the bank's architecture migration to a thin-client, web-based transactional system supporting
      700 outlets and 14,000 users developed in Java.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
       
      <h5 class="container-block-title">Architecting call-centre solutions for Vodacom</h5>
      In 2006 he consulted at Vodacom South Africa as JEE architect and assumed in 2007 the role of Acting Manager Systems Design of 
      the Vodacom Commercial System Group. As the lead architect he was responsible for technical solutions across 12 call-centres, 550 retail franchises 
      and 15,000 users and was instrumental in the migration from the old WebSphere stack, the implementation of open-source solutions, the compliance 
      with PCI and SOX and acted as an evangelist for open source technologies and portal technologies within the organisation.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      <h5 class="container-block-title">Building South Africa's largest Java e-commerce platform and marketplace</h5>
      In 2010 he joined bidorbuy, Africa's largest e-commerce marketplace, with the mandate to scale up the existing IT infrastructure 
      and create functional teams to run DevOps / IT-operations. Bidorbuy's e-commerce infrastructure was re-architected to run on a scalable private cloud 
      infrastructure (using CentOS Xen hypervisor running on IBM Bladecenters) with clustered web-applications developed in Java running as fully stateless 
      applications on Tomcat application servers. Several large-scale projects such as Apache Solr for e-commerce search, in-house iOS-/Android-/Windows- &amp; 
      Blackberry native application developed was managed by in-house staff.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      Gerd led and personally implemented SEO and SEM projects which included Rich Snippets, Google Tag Manager (including data-layers for 
      e-commerce) and 3rd party product data feeds to Google Merchant Centre, remarketing companies (Criteo, RTB) and affiliates.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      A revamped email-infrastucture using Port25 allowed bidorbuy to transmit up to 2 million transactional- and marketing emails per hour. 
      The privately developed <a title="PowerMTA Port25 bouncehandler" href="https://github.com/magicdude4eva/port25-bouncehandler" target="_blank">Port25 bouncehandler</a> 
      was deployed at bidorbuy and manages all bounce-handling.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      Improvements in DevOps comprised the rollout of a centralised log-management system using Graylog, Logstash and Elasticsearch as well 
      as the deployment of a full SDLC suite using Atlassian stack (JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket and Fisheye) with continuous integration of Android and iOS via 
      Jenkins and application performance management via New Relic. Private cloud servers are managed via SaltStack and monitored through Zabbix.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      <h5 class="container-block-title">What I strive for:</h5>
      I enjoy developing and delivering systems but also relish the human side and I get the most out of my work when I am interacting 
      losely with project stakeholders to deliver systems that add value and give a return on investment. I have the ability to motivate and manage my team 
      to ensure the best results.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      My emphasis tends to be on creating systems based on sound technical designs. Pragmatism, using sound software engineering principles 
      and applying software patterns are important. Quality and usability are key drivers. I am inclined to use multiple tools or environments to create 
      systems. I have vast experience with a variety of tools, operating systems, development techniques, software products and prefer open-source solutions 
      over commercial options.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      I am a professional who likes to work in small teams where I prefer a leading consultative role towards clients and colleagues. 
      During the last 25 years of my career I was regularly involved with the management of my employees and my clients as consultant, sparring partner 
      and critic. I appreciate honesty and clarity without resorting to social engineering or political games. I believe in reaching goals as a collective 
      and sharing the results. When dealing with clients I exhibit a service-oriented- and coaching-approach.
      {: style="text-align: justify;"}
      
      **PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:** I can add great value and opportunities to your organisation and can be confidently placed 
      in the positions of: Enterprise Architect, team-lead/manager of enterprise-/application-architecture team, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), 
      Chief Information Officer (CIO), team-lead/manager/executive of development. I enjoy hands-on work and find myself most of the time in a Linux
